# Ex.No: 11  Planning â€“  Block World Problem 
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221060265
### AIM: 
To find the sequence of plan for Block word problem using PDDL  
###  Algorithm:
Step 1 :  Start the program <br>
Step 2 : Create a domain for Block world Problem <br>
Step 3 :  Create a domain by specifying predicates clear, on table, on, arm-empty, holding. <br>
Step 4 : Specify the actions pickup, putdown, stack and un-stack in Block world problem <br>
Step 5 :  In pickup action, Robot arm pick the block on table. Precondition is Block is on table and no other block on specified block and arm-hand empty.<br>
Step 6:  In putdown action, Robot arm place the block on table. Precondition is robot-arm holding the block.<br>
Step 7 : In un-stack action, Robot arm pick the block on some block. Precondition is Block is on another block and no other block on specified block and arm-hand empty.<br>
Step 8 : In stack action, Robot arm place the block on under block. Precondition is Block holded by robot arm and no other block on under block.<br>
Step 9 : Define a problem for block world problem.<br> 
Step 10 : Obtain the plan for given problem.<br> 

###  domain.pddl
### Program:

  (define (domain blocksworld)
  
  (:requirements :strips :equality)
  
  (:predicates (clear ?x)
  
           (on-table ?x)
           
           (arm-empty)
           
           (holding ?x)
           
           (on ?x ?y))
  (:action pickup
  
      :parameters (?ob)
  
      :precondition (and (clear ?ob) (on-table ?ob) (arm-empty))
      
      :effect (and (holding ?ob) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (on-table ?ob))
      
           (not (arm-empty))))
 
  (:action putdown
  
      :parameters (?ob)
      
      :precondition (and (holding ?ob))
      
      :effect (and (clear ?ob) (arm-empty) (on-table ?ob)
      
           (not (holding ?ob))))

  (:action stack
  
      :parameters (?ob ?underob)
      
      :precondition (and (clear ?underob) (holding ?ob))
      
      :effect (and (arm-empty) (clear ?ob) (on ?ob ?underob)
      
            (not (clear ?underob)) (not (holding ?ob))))
            
  (:action unstack
    
      :parameters (?ob ?underob)
      
      :precondition (and (on ?ob ?underob) (clear ?ob) (arm-empty))
      
      :effect (and (holding ?ob) (clear ?underob)
      
           (not (on ?ob ?underob)) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (arm-empty)))))

### Input 
### Problem 1: Problem.pddl

 (define (problem pb1)
 
      (:domain blocksworld)
 
      (:objects a b)
      
      (:init (on-table a) (on-table b) (clear a) (clear b) (arm-empty))
      
      (:goal (and (on a b))))

### Problem 2: Problem2.pddl

 (define(problem pb3)

      (:domain blocksworld)
      
      (:objects a b c)
      
      (:init (on-table a) (on-table b) (on-table c)
      
           (clear a) (clear b) (clear c) (arm-empty))
      
      (:goal (and (on a b) (on b c))))

### Output/Plan:

### Result:
Thus the plan was found for the initial and goal state of block world problem.
